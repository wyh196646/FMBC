### ðŸ”¨ 1. **Installation**:
- Create an environment: `conda create -n "trident" python=3.10`, and activate it `conda activate trident`.
- **Install from local clone**:
    - `git clone https://github.com/mahmoodlab/trident.git && cd trident`.
    - Local install with running `pip install -e .`.
- **Install with pip**:
    - `pip install git+https://github.com/mahmoodlab/trident.git `
- Additional packages may be required for loading some pretrained models. Follow error messages for instructions.

### ðŸ”¨ 2. **Running Trident**:

**Already familiar with WSI processing?** Interested in patch embeddings? Perform segmentation, patching, and UNI feature extraction for a directory of WSIs in a single command:

```
python run_batch_of_slides.py --task all --wsi_dir wsis --job_dir ./trident_processed --patch_encoder uni_v1 --mag 20 --patch_size 256
```

**Feeling cautious?**

Run this script to perform all processing steps for just a single slide:
```
python run_single_slide.py --slide_path wsis/xxxx.svs --job_dir ./trident_processed --patch_encoder uni_v1 --mag 20 --patch_size 256
```

**Or follow step-by-step instructions:**

**Step 1: Tissue Segmentation:** Segments tissue vs. background from a list of WSIs
 - **Command**:
   ```bash
   python run_batch_of_slides.py --task seg --wsi_dir ./wsis --job_dir ./trident_processed --gpu 0 --segmenter hest
   ```
   - `--task seg`: Specifies that you want to do tissue segmentation.
   - `--wsi_dir ./wsis`: Path to the directory containing WSIs.
   - `--job_dir ./trident_processed`: Output directory for processed results.
   - `--gpu 0`: Uses GPU with index 0 for computation.
   - `--segmenter`: Segmentation model. Defaults to `hest`. Switch to `grandqc` for fast H&E segmentation.
 - **Outputs**:
   - WSI thumbnails are saved in `./trident_processed/thumbnails`.
   - WSI thumbnails annotated with tissue contours are saved in `./trident_processed/contours`.
   - GeoJSON files containing tissue contours are saved in `./trident_processed/contours_geojson`. These can be opened in [QuPath](https://qupath.github.io/) for editing/quality control, if necessary.

 **Step 2: Tissue Patching:** Extracts patches from segmented tissue regions at a specific magnification.
 - **Command**:
   ```bash
   python run_batch_of_slides.py --task coords --wsi_dir wsis --job_dir ./trident_processed --mag 20 --patch_size 256 --overlap 0
   ```
   - `--task coords`: Specifies that you want to do patching.
   - `--wsi_dir wsis`: Path to the directory containing WSIs.
   - `--job_dir ./trident_processed`: Output directory for processed results.
   - `--mag 20`: Extracts patches at 20x magnification.
   - `--patch_size 256`: Each patch is 256x256 pixels.
   - `--overlap 0`: Patches overlap by 0 pixels. Note that this is the absolute overlap in pixels, i.e. use `--overlap 128` for 50% overlap on patches of size 256.
 - **Outputs**:
   - Patch coordinates are saved as h5 files in `./trident_processed/20x_256px/patches`.
   - WSI thumbnails annotated with patch borders are saved in `./trident_processed/20x_256px/visualization`.

 **Step 3a: Patch Feature Extraction:** Extracts features from tissue patches using a specified encoder
 - **Command**:
   ```bash
   python run_batch_of_slides.py --task feat --wsi_dir wsis --job_dir ./trident_processed --patch_encoder uni_v1 --mag 20 --patch_size 256 
   ```
   - `--task feat`: Specifies that you want to do feature extraction.
   - `--wsi_dir wsis`: Path to the directory containing WSIs.
   - `--job_dir ./trident_processed`: Output directory for processed results.
   - `--patch_encoder uni_v1`: Uses the `UNIv1` patch encoder. See below for list of supported models. 
   - `--mag 20`: Features are extracted from patches at 20x magnification.
   - `--patch_size 256`: Patches are 256x256 pixels in size.
 - **Outputs**: 
   - Features are saved as h5 files in `./trident_processed/20x_256px/features_uni_v1`. (Shape: `(n_patches, feature_dim)`)

Trident supports 20 patch encoders, loaded via a patch-level [`encoder_factory`](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/trident/blob/main/trident/patch_encoder_models/load.py#L14).

> [!NOTE]
> If you have a patient containing multiple slides, you have two ways for constructing whole-patient embeddings: processing each slide independently and taking the average of the slide features (late fusion) or pooling all patches together and processing that as a single "pseudo-slide" (early fusion). You can use Trident-generated slide embeddings in your own late fusion pipeline, or use Trident-generated patch embeddings in your own early fusion pipeline. For an implementation of both fusion strategies, please check out our sister repository [Patho-Bench](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/Patho-Bench).

Please see our [tutorials](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/trident/tree/main/tutorials) for more cool things you can do with Trident and a more [detailed readme](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/trident/blob/main/DETAILS.md) for additional features.

### ðŸ™‹ FAQ
- **Q**: How do I extract patch embeddings from legacy patch coordinates extracted with [CLAM](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/CLAM)?
   - **A**:
      ```bash
      python run_batch_of_slides.py --task feat --wsi_dir ..wsis --job_dir legacy_dir --patch_encoder uni_v1 --mag 20 --patch_size 256 --coords_dir extracted_mag20x_patch256_fp/
      ```
- **Q**: How do I keep patches corresponding to holes in the tissue?
   - **A**: In `run_batch_of_slides`, this behavior is default. Set `--remove_holes` to exclude patches on top of holes.

- **Q**: I see weird messages when building models using timm. What is happening?
   - **A**: Make sure `timm==0.9.16` is installed. `timm==1.X.X` creates issues with most models. 

- **Q**: How can I use `run_single_slide.py` and `run_batch_of_slides.py` in other repos with minimal work?
  - **A**: Make sure `trident` is installed using `pip install -e .`. Then, both scripts are exposed and can be integrated into any Python code, e.g., as

```python
import sys 
from run_single_slide import main

sys.argv = [
    "run_single_slide",
    '--slide_path', "output/wsis/394140.svs",
    "--job_dir", 'output/',
    "--mag", "20",
    "--patch_size", '256'
]

main()
```

- **Q**: I am not satisfied with the tissue vs background segmentation. What can I do?
   - **A**: Trident uses GeoJSON to store and load segmentations. This format is natively supported by [QuPath](https://qupath.github.io/). You can load the Trident segmentation into QuPath, modify it using QuPath's annotation tools, and save the updated segmentation back to GeoJSON.
   - **A**: You can try another segmentation model by specifying `segmenter --grandqc`.

- **Q**: I want to process a custom list of WSIs. Can I do it? Also, most of my WSIs don't have the micron per pixel (mpp) stored. Can I pass it?
   - **A**: Yes using the `--custom_list_of_wsis` argument. Provide a list of WSI names in a CSV (with slide extension, `wsi`). Optionally, provide the mpp (field `mpp`)
 
 - **Q**: Do I need to install any additional packages to use Trident?
   - **A**: Most pretrained models require additional dependencies (e.g., the CTransPath patch encoder requires `pip install timm_ctp`). When you load a model using Trident, it will tell you what dependencies are missing and how to install them.
